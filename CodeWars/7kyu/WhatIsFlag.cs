What is the flag?

ðŸš© What is the flag?
The flag is hidden in the string variable FLAG
The flag is in the format FLAG{CAPITAL-LETTERS-WITH-HYPHEN}
The flag couldn't be found from the string literal right away... but You can indeed see it somehow!
A magic number 16 might help... but how should it be used?
